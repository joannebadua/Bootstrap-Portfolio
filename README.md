# About
This is a portfolio site built by Bootstrap and CSS.  It includes a navigation bar from Bootstrap. It also has a responsive layout with grids, rows and columns using CSS.  Responsiveness means that on an extra small screen, the content, including images, takes up the entire screen.  On small and larger screens, there are some margins on the left and right side of the screen. This alows the user to visit the site on both a mobile device and a computer.
There was an attempt to use a sticky footer and sub-rows and sub-columns on the portfolio.

Search Engine Optimization and Accessibility features incorporated.
