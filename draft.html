                  My name is Joey Badua. I go by the pronouns she/they. I was born in the Philippines, and grew up in San
                  Francisco, California and Honolulu, Hawaii. I like to practice yoga and the law. I was a deputy public
                  defender in Hawaii, working in the appellate and trial divisions. I have tried felony cases in juvenile
                  court. I represented clients facing involuntary commitments in mental hospitals, as well as convicted
                  inmates in minimum, parole and parole revocation hearings. I worked with clients from all walks of life,
                  and was able to put myself in their shoes to represent them. In the stressors of today's world, I try to
                  live a more compassionate life and be present in every interaction I have with people and nature.
